# Abstract breakdown


> The wobbling properties of an odd-$A$ triaxial nucleus are studied within a semi-classical framework. 

* Emphasize the importance of a classical interpretation for a quantal system. 
* Use the description from Budaca's paper: ![[Pasted image 20211105202529.png]] Namely, the classical methods provides the advantage of keeping close contact with the system's dynamics. ![[Pasted image 20211105202714.png]]
* Mention the previous work on the semi-classical approach used to describe the wobbling features of odd-A nuclei

> Starting from a Particle-Rotor quantal Hamiltonian that is dequantized via the time-dependent variational principle, a set of analytical expressions for the wobbling frequencies, excitation energies, dynamical moments of inertia, and other relevant quantities are obtained. 

* Illustrate the total quantal Hamiltonian for a particle + rotor system. The odd particle + triaxial rotor coupling
* Explain the key aspects of the variational principle. Show the Time-Dependent-Variational-Equation (TDVE).
* Step-by-step procedure to obtain the set of classical equations, starting from the initial quantal Hamiltonian. ![[variationalPrinciple.png]]

> The unique feature of this current approach is the re-definition of the wobbling band structure that is specific to the collective modes of excitation in triaxial nuclei.

* Provide the current concept of defining the wobbling bands in a triaxial nucleus, such as $^{163}$Lu. Present the existing *consensus* on the wobbling band structure.
* Illustrate the coupling of the triaxial rotor (even-even core) with the odd $j$-particle (odd nucleon).
* Step-1: signature partner bands
	* Explain the wobbling mechanism, and the collective excitations by considering that bands TSD1 and TSD2 are signature partners. Justification is that the potential well (calculated in the work given in 2017 papeR) is very deep, such that the two bands share the same minima.
	* The first step implies that the first two bands have the same intrinsic structure, meaning that both spin sequences emerge from the same core + particle coupling,  that is the odd $j=13/2$ proton.
* Step-2: parity-partner bands
	* Imply that the wave-function accepts both solutions of positive and negative parity.
	* The bands TSD2 and TSD4 share the same odd-particle and same spin sequences, however, the two cores that couple with the odd particle have opposite parity.

Namely, the zero-, one-, and two-wobbling phonon bands which comprise a family of three such bands becomes a ground-state band with even spin states for the triaxial rotor, the ground-state band with odd spin states for the triaxial rotor, and one-wobbling phonon band for the third.

Using this re-definition of the wobbling band structure, the obtained theoretical results for the energy spectrum in $^{163}$Lu agree with the experimental data quite well. 

Moreover, the model is able to describe nuclear states of both positive and negative parity, thus being able to accurately depict an additional wobbling band that is comprised of states with negative parity. 

The obtained semi-classical expression of the energy function is also analyzed within a coordinate space that can predict the wobbling behavior of a nucleus with increasing total angular momentum (i.e., stable or unstable wobbling regime).
