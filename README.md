## Abstract

The wobbling properties of an odd-$A$ triaxial nucleus are studied within a semi-classical framework. Starting from a Particle-Rotor quantal Hamiltonian that is dequantized via the time-dependent variational principle, a set of analytical expressions for the wobbling frequencies, excitation energies, dynamical moments of inertia, and other relevant quantities are obtained. The unique feature of this current approach is the re-definition of the wobbling band structure that is specific to the collective modes of excitation in triaxial nuclei. Namely, the zero-, one-, and two-wobbling phonon bands which comprise a family of three such bands becomes a ground-state band with even spin states for the triaxial rotor, the ground-state band with odd spin states for the triaxial rotor, and one-wobbling phonon band for the third. Using this re-definition of the wobbling band structure, the obtained theoretical results for the energy spectrum in $^{163}$Lu agree with the experimental data quite well. Moreover, the model is able to describe nuclear states of both positive and negative parity, thus being able to accurately depict an additional wobbling band that is comprised of states with negative parity. The obtained semi-classical expression of the energy function is also analyzed within a coordinate space that can predict the wobbling behavior of a nucleus with increasing total angular momentum (i.e., stable or unstable wobbling regime).
